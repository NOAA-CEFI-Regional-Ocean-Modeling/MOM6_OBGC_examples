This tool can be use to build the executable for the model.
E.g., on machine gaea for platform intel16:

./linux-build-mom6sis2.bash -m gaea -p intel16 -t prod -b ocean_ice

This assumes that the files build/gaea/intel16.env and build/gaea/intel16.mk exist.
-  build/gaea/intel16.env contains all the necessary environment variables and modules
that must be loaded before a build / run on that machine
-  build/gaea/intel16.mk  contains the compile instructions for the particular compiler and machine
